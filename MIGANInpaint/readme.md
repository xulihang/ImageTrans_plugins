## MIGAN inpainting plugin for ImageTrans

### How to Use


You need to put [migan_pipeline_v2.onnx](https://huggingface.co/andraniksargsyan/migan/resolve/main/migan_pipeline_v2.onnx) ([国内地址](https://hf-mirror.com/andraniksargsyan/migan/resolve/main/migan_pipeline_v2.onnx)) under ImageTrans's folder.



PS: MIGAN will resize images too large so it is recommended to process by text areas. You can enable this in the project settings.
