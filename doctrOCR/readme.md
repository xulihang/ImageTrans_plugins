# doctrOCR


1. Install Python and DocTROCR.
2. Install bottle and Paste: `pip install bottle Paste`
3. Run the following to start the server: `python server.py`
4. Download the plugin files and put `doctrOCRPlugin.jar` and `doctrOCRPlugin.xml` into the plugins folder of ImageTrans.

For convenience, you can directly use the Windows package: [link](https://github.com/xulihang/ImageTrans_plugins/releases/download/plugins/DocTROCR.zip).

Unzip the file and start `run.bat` to run the server. You need to keep the server running in the background.

If you failed to download the model, you can [download the models](https://github.com/xulihang/ImageTrans_plugins/releases/download/plugins/doctr-models.zip) and unzip them to `C:\Users\<your username>\.cache\doctr\models\`.
