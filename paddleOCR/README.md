## PaddleOCR

The plugin is bundled with ImageTrans. You just need to start the PaddleOCR server.

1. Install Python and PaddleOCR.
2. Install bottle and Paste: `pip install bottle Paste`
3. Run the following to start the server: `python server_paddleocr.py`

For convenience, you can directly use the Windows package: [link](https://github.com/xulihang/ImageTrans_plugins/releases/download/plugins/PaddleOCR.zip).

Unzip the file and start `run.bat` to run the server. You need to keep the server running in the background.
