Usage:

1. Enter your key in the API preference settings.
2. You can customize the prompt in the settings as well. The default prompt is `Translate the following into {langcode}: {source}`. `{langcode}` and `{source}` will be replaced with the name of the target language and the source text. An example after replacing is like this: `Translate the following into Chinese: Hello world!`.
3. You can use third-party ChatGPT hosts by setting the host parameter.
